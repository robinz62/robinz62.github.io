          <b>Electronic Health Record System for Heart for Africa</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>
            During our senior year of college, a couple of friends and I built a fully-fledged,
            custom EHR for nurses working for nonprofit
            <a href="https://www.heartforafrica.org/" target="_blank" class="black-link">Heart for Africa</a>,
            located in Eswatini, Africa. The system would replace paper files, which became
            unwieldy as the number of children being cared for grew to the order of hundreds.
            In July of 2019, three of us hopped on a plane, suitcase equipped with a few
            electronics, to install the system onsite.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Check out the poster we made for class:
            <a href="files/hfa-ehr-poster-2019.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="img/hfa-ehr-poster-2019-thumbnail.png"
                width=100%></a>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            On the software side, the product was built as a web application (MERN stack) with
            a nice modern UI. Intended to work with limited resources, in particular very
            unreliable internet access, the server is able to run on a Raspberry Pi right in the
            building. Connected to a router by ethernet, it provides local access from other
            devices (in our case, the nurses had personal laptops). Also, each day, a cron job
            attempts to upload a full backup of the data to the cloud (with highly variable
            success rate).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Despite unreliable internet access and non-static IP of the Pi, through a series of
            complicated connections and procedures we were able to ensure ourselves sporadic
            ssh access into the server, just good enough to allow us to send and install software
            updates and debug any issues.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            As of updating this (Aug 2020), the entire project is around 50k lines of code, and
            we're still in contact with and supporting the nurses over there :D.

            Inspired by the question of just how many thumbs down reacts one of my friends
            received in our beloved group chat, I wrote some scripts to process and visualize
            some potentially interesting stats from Facebook Messenger data.

            This website lol. Initially created to teach myself rudimentary HTML/CSS and because
            it seemed everyone else had one. Updated every now and then when I have nothing
            better to do.
